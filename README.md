# Brainbrawl frontend
## Problem Statement:
"In an era where educational institutions seek advanced and seamless methods for academic assessments, a challenge persists in providing user-friendly, real-time evaluation platforms for universities and colleges. The current systems often lack interactive features and fail to deliver an engaging 1v1 contest-based assessment experience. The absence of such an effective evaluation platform hinders the enhancement of learning experiences and the achievement of academic excellence within educational institutions. This prompts the need to address the deficiency by developing an innovative, comprehensive solution that facilitates real-time, user-friendly evaluations while fostering interactive 1v1 contest-based assessments, aligning with the project's vision to empower educational institutions and promote enhanced learning experiences."

## Solution : 
Welcome to the Brain-Brawl Django REST application repository! This backend application is designed to support the Flutter-based "Brain-Brawl" application, where students from different universities can compete in knockout competitions involving assessments that challenge both accuracy and speed.

## About The Project : 
We provide a 1-on-1 learning experience in knockout series form, whereas, when you start a game you are matched with a player who also joined under the same subject as you did, and from there you both get to battle each other by answering assessments that require both accuracy and speed to win. Winners will rise on the leaderboard until there is only one winner among all the universities participating in the knockout competition.

## Vision : 
"Empowering educational institutions through seamless, user-friendly online examination platforms, fostering interactive 1v1 contest-based assessments for enhanced learning experiences and academic excellence."

## Mission : 
"Our mission is to provide educational institutions with seamless, user-friendly online examination platforms that enable interactive 1v1 contest-based assessments. By fostering these experiences, we aim to enhance learning methodologies, promoting academic excellence and fostering a conducive environment for educational growth and achievement."
  
## How does it work?
Upon logging in, users will be directed to a webpage displaying all currently active competitions. Participating in a knockout competition entails being paired with a student from another university who has also enrolled under the same subject. Subsequently, both participants engage in a timed battle, answering assessments within 30-45 seconds. Success in this competition necessitates a blend of accuracy and speed. As participants progress, winners ascend on the leaderboard until ultimately, a single winner emerges among all the universities involved in the knockout competition.
